### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 Part 2 the Blackjack game was one of my favorite labs because we were able to make a popular game through coding. Although it was pretty tough at first, it was quite rewarding to see the outcome of the hard work. I played blackjack against a bot prior to this lab, and it worked the same way, so it was great to learn how this worked.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was the object-oriented HiLo game we made. It was also one of my favorite labs because I learned how to use a randomizer for the computer to come up with randomly generated numbers. I never knew how randomizers worked, but I knew what they did, so being able to implement them in my code was extremely useful. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was my favorite lab from intro to programming. Here I was able to code my animated image. Animated gifs are so widely used that I was partly interested in how they worked. So I found interest in making an animation through C++. I never realized that the computer worked through columns and rows to generate animated pictures.
