### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 Part 2 the Blackjack game was one of my favorite labs because we were able to make a popular game through coding. Although it was pretty tough at first, it was quite rewarding to see the outcome of the hard work. I have similarly played blackjack against a bot before and it worked the exact same way so it was great to learn how it exactly worked. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 part 2 was the object-oriented HiLo game we made. It was also one of my favorite labs because we were able to both learn and use a randomizer for the computer to come up with randomly generated numbers. I never knew how randomizers worked, but I knew what they did so being able to implement it in my own code was a useful experience. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 2 was by far my favorite lab for intro to programming. Here I was able to code my own animated image. Animated gifs are so widely used that I was partly interested in how they worked. So it was awesome to be able to make my own animation and learn how it works through C++.
